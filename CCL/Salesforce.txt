With this structure:

- Each enrollment record in the Enrollment object represents a specific student's enrollment in a specific course.
- Assignments and Exams are directly related to specific courses.
- Both the Student and Course objects have no direct lookup fields to the Enrollment object. Instead, you access enrollment records through the junction object.
- This structure allows for flexible management of student enrollments, assignments, and exams within the context of various courses.
